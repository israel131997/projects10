    <h2>Blog</h2>
    <p>The path to becoming a web developer seems stressful and complicated, but I have to give it my all if I want to succeed. I believe I have the basic knowledge of HTML; however, I know there's tons of new and exciting ways to learn. One thing I've found interesting is that anyone can build a website. You just have to put in the time to create websites that look like they belong in art galleries.</p>
